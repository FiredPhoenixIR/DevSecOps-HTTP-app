Now, we will need to create a virtual environment and install all the dependencies:

```bash
$ python3 -m venv venv  # on Windows, use "python -m venv venv" instead
$ . venv/bin/activate  # on Windows, use "venv\Scripts\activate" instead
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

## How to Run a Specific Example Application?
